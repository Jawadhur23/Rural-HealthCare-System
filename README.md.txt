The Problem Statement was:
	Design a scalable Rurwal Health Care System to monitor the Parameters of the people in a village 

1. GIZMOCON_HACKATHON: This Arduino FIle contains the main Program for Interfacing Sensors such as SpO2, Heart Rate, Body Temperature, Blood Pressure, and ECG Signal In which these things are combined and provided as an Single Arduino File


2. An Fingerprint Sensor is associated with an Authentication in which Two-step authentication is associated 


3. FIREBASE: The Firebase database is used for Storing data which is taken from Sensors  which is associated with logging the Data 


4. The Firebase database which will store all the data of input in the the sensors in the database


5. MIT App Inventor(GizmoconApp.aia): We have used an MIT App Inventor file name GizmoconApp.aia by using MIT App Inventor we have created two or more Logins created for accessing by the doctor, Patient accessing the Previous data 


6. but we created present data Accessing, by Doctor when he uses the username, Password he can see the 2 patient details 


7. Patients also will have separate usernames, and passwords for accessing when they use the password, and username to access they will see the details of the Report 


8. MACHINE LEARNING(Flint): The file name Flint is an Machine Learning program we have trained an Model Which will be working as when it has an dataset of three Sensor values it will give an Health Level of an Person


9. The Health Level of a Person is in 3 Modes 


10. The datasets when it takes specific values of three sensors will provide Data of the Health Level of a person 


********** We have created The Smart Health Monitoring System Which will be feasible for the User to use**********
